# HTML

## Link to Internal Sections of a Page with Anchor Elements

To create an internal link, you assign a link's href attribute to a hash symbol # plus the value of the id attribute for the element that you want to internally link to, usually further down the page. You then need to add the same id attribute to the element you are linking to. An id is an attribute that uniquely describes an element.

## Use the value attribute with Radio Buttons and Checkboxes

When a form gets submitted, the data is sent to the server and includes entries for the options selected. Inputs of type radio and checkbox report their values from the value attribute.

CSS has been adopted by all major browsers and allows you to control:

- color
- fonts
- positioning
- spacing
- sizing
- decorations
- transitions

There are several default fonts that are available in all browsers. These generic font families include monospace, serif and sans-serif. When one font isn't available, you can tell the browser to "degrade" to another font.
