## What is a RESTful API?

**REST** stands for **Re**presentational **S**tate **T**ransfer and defines a set of standards for web services. An API is an interface that different software programs use to communicate with each other. Therefore, a RESTful API is an API that conforms to the REST architectural style and constraints. REST systems are stateless, scalable, cacheable, and have a uniform interface.

RESTful APIs most commonly utilize HTTP requests. Four of the most common HTTP methods are `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE`, which are the methods by which a developer can create a CRUD system â€“ create, read, update, delete.
