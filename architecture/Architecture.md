## [Why A Good Setup Matters for Node.js Apps](https://scoutapm.com/blog/nodejs-architecture-and-12-best-practices-for-nodejs-development) üè†

- Coherent, well-defined structure for clarity
- Reusability, modularity, and separation of concerns
- Simplicity for better understanding
- Easy debugging and maintenance
- Automated testing, logging mechanisms
- Employing best programming, development principles

### Best Practice #1: Take a Layered Approach üßÅ üåà
### Best Practice #2: Publisher Subscriber Models üì°
- pub/sub pattern can be set up in Node.js using the Events API

### Best Practice #3: Third-party solutions

- Nodemon, (automatically restarts application when code files are updated)
- Gulp, Grunt, (automated task runners)
- Winston, (logging framework)
- Agenda (job scheduling), 
- Moment (working with date & time)

### Best Practice #11: Follow good generic coding practices

- DRY (Don‚Äôt Repeat Yourself)
- Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- ‚ÄúKeep it simple, stupid‚Äù (KISS)
- Separation of Concerns
- YAGNI (You ain‚Äôt gonna need it)
- Avoid premature optimization
- S.O.L.I.D programming principles
- Dependency injection
